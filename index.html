        <p>This is my first HTML design!
        I'm <mark><b>Eyad Al-Owaimer</b></mark>, a passionate young developer specializing in web development. I'm currently a Programming and Computer Science student at Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University.
        Today, I proudly completed the HTML course — it was an exciting and insightful journey. This marks the beginning of my path toward mastering full-stack development.
        Stay tuned for more creativity, elegance, and well-structured projects in the near future! <br> 
        To enhance the visual styling of this project, I sought assistance from ChatGPT in creating and improving the CSS file. Stay tuned for more creativity, elegance, and well-structured projects in the near future!
